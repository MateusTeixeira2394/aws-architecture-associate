# 1. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

**AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** is a service that simplifies the provisioning, management, and deployment of SSL/TLS certificates for securing network communications and establishing identity on the internet. With ACM, you can request public and private certificates, deploy them to AWS services, and handle certificate renewals automatically.

## 1.1. Key Features of AWS ACM:

1. **Certificate Provisioning**:

   - ACM allows you to easily request SSL/TLS certificates to secure your websites, APIs, and applications. These certificates can be used to enable HTTPS for your domains or to secure network traffic between services.

2. **Automated Certificate Renewal**:

   - One of the most powerful features of ACM is automatic certificate renewal. Once deployed, ACM manages the renewal process for public certificates, ensuring your applications remain secure without manual intervention.

3. **Public and Private Certificates**:

   - **Public Certificates**: ACM can issue publicly trusted SSL/TLS certificates that secure websites and internet-facing services.
   - **Private Certificates**: ACM integrates with AWS Private Certificate Authority (CA) to issue and manage private certificates for internal applications that donâ€™t require public trust.

4. **Easy Integration with AWS Services**:

   - ACM certificates can be deployed on various AWS services such as:
     - Amazon CloudFront (Content Delivery Network)
     - Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
     - Amazon API Gateway
     - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
   - ACM simplifies the integration of SSL/TLS certificates with these services, making it easier to secure them with just a few clicks.

5. **Managed Certificate Lifecycle**:

   - ACM manages the entire lifecycle of certificates, including provisioning, deployment, and renewal, reducing the operational overhead for developers and administrators.

6. **Cost Efficiency**:

   - **Free Public Certificates**: ACM offers public certificates at no cost, making it cost-effective for securing websites and other internet-facing services.
   - Private certificates may incur costs, especially when integrating with AWS Private CA.

7. **Certificate Validation**:
   - ACM offers three methods to validate domain ownership before issuing certificates:
     - Email validation
     - DNS validation (preferred for automated renewal)
     - HTTP validation

## 1.2. Use Cases:

- **Securing Websites**: Use ACM to provision SSL/TLS certificates that secure website traffic by enabling HTTPS.
- **Protecting APIs**: Deploy certificates to secure communication between clients and APIs hosted on AWS.
- **Internal Applications**: Use ACM with AWS Private CA to manage private certificates for securing internal applications.

## 1.3. Benefits of AWS ACM:

- **Simplifies SSL/TLS Certificate Management**: ACM handles all aspects of certificate management, from issuance to deployment and renewal, reducing administrative burdens.
- **Automatic Renewals**: Removes the risk of expired certificates by automatically renewing certificates before they expire.
- **Cost-Effective**: Public certificates issued by ACM are free, and you only pay for AWS services using the certificates.
- **Secure**: Certificates are provisioned, managed, and stored securely within AWS, adhering to industry standards for SSL/TLS.

## 1.4. Summary:

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) streamlines the process of requesting, deploying, and managing SSL/TLS certificates. It automatically handles certificate renewals and integrates seamlessly with various AWS services, helping you secure websites, APIs, and internal applications without manual certificate management.
