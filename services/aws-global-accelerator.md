# 1. AWS Global Accelerator üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí®

**AWS Global Accelerator** is a networking service that improves the performance and availability of your applications by routing traffic through the AWS global network infrastructure. It delivers a faster, more reliable experience for users by directing traffic to optimal AWS endpoints, such as **EC2 instances**, **Elastic Load Balancers (ALBs/NLBs)**, and **AWS Global Accelerator endpoints**, while intelligently routing around network congestion, latency, and failures.

## 1.1. Key Features of AWS Global Accelerator

1. **Global Anycast IP Addresses**:

   - When you create a Global Accelerator, you are assigned two static **Anycast IP addresses**. These IPs are globally unique and can be used as fixed entry points to your application, no matter where your application endpoints are hosted.
   - Traffic sent to these Anycast IPs is automatically routed to the closest AWS Region with healthy application endpoints, improving performance and reducing latency.

2. **Traffic Acceleration**:

   - AWS Global Accelerator routes traffic over the **AWS global network**, which is highly redundant and optimized for low latency, bypassing much of the congestion of the public internet.
   - It shortens the path users take to access your application by using the nearest AWS edge location, ensuring traffic is quickly and securely forwarded to your application.

3. **Intelligent Traffic Routing**:

   - It continuously monitors the health and availability of your application endpoints and dynamically reroutes traffic to the next best available endpoint if one becomes unhealthy, providing **fault tolerance** and **high availability**.
   - The service optimizes traffic flow based on latency, geography, and health checks of the endpoints.

4. **Automatic Failover**:

   - In case of an endpoint failure or network issue, AWS Global Accelerator automatically redirects traffic to healthy endpoints without manual intervention. This helps to minimize downtime and maintain application availability.

5. **Integration with AWS Services**:

   - Global Accelerator integrates seamlessly with AWS services such as **Elastic Load Balancers (ALB/NLB)**, **EC2**, and **Elastic IPs**. It can be used for both **TCP** and **UDP** traffic.
   - You can configure listeners for the traffic and endpoints, ensuring that traffic is routed as per your configuration.

6. **Security and DDoS Protection**:

   - Global Accelerator benefits from the built-in **DDoS protection** provided by **AWS Shield**. This ensures that your application is more resilient to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and other security threats.

7. **Static IP Addressing**:
   - The static IP addresses provided by Global Accelerator allow you to maintain a consistent entry point for your application, simplifying DNS management and failover configurations.

## 1.2. Key Use Cases

- **Global Applications**: For applications with a global user base, Global Accelerator can reduce latency by directing user traffic to the nearest regional endpoint.
- **Disaster Recovery and Failover**: It helps ensure high availability by automatically routing traffic to healthy regions during failover scenarios.
- **Gaming and Real-time Applications**: For use cases requiring low-latency and fast network response times, such as gaming, streaming, or financial services.
- **Data-Intensive Applications**: Applications that require high-performance networking for real-time communication between distributed components.

## 1.3. AWS Global Accelerator vs. Amazon CloudFront

- **Global Accelerator**: Optimizes performance for **non-HTTP/S** use cases (like TCP/UDP traffic) and routes traffic directly to AWS services (like EC2, ALB).
- **CloudFront**: A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** that caches static and dynamic content closer to users at AWS Edge locations, primarily for **HTTP/S** traffic.

## 1.4. Benefits

- **Improved performance**: Reduced latency by routing traffic through the AWS global network.
- **Higher availability**: Automatic traffic failover ensures minimal downtime.
- **Global reach**: Optimized for applications with a global user base.
- **Ease of use**: Static IP addresses simplify traffic
