# AWS Health Dashboard

## Overview  
AWS Health Dashboard gives you a personalized view of the health of AWS services and your AWS resources. It helps you monitor and respond to events that might affect your infrastructure, availability, or performance.

---

## Why use the Health Dashboard?

- **Proactive awareness** — Know when AWS is doing maintenance or experiencing issues in your region or globally  
- **Personalized impact** — See which of your resources might be affected (not just generic service status)  
- **Timely alerts** — Receive notifications when AWS identifies events that could interrupt your workloads  
- **Operational insights** — Understand into root causes, remediation steps, and timeline of events

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Service Health Events** | Displays ongoing and past events (outages, maintenance) that impact AWS services in your region(s) |
| **Account-level Health** | Shows which of *your* resources (e.g. EC2, RDS) are affected by AWS events |
| **Event details & timeline** | Provides status updates, root cause analysis, resolution steps, and event history |
| **Integrations & notifications** | You can integrate with Amazon CloudWatch Events / EventBridge or SNS to alert your operations team |
| **Scheduled changes** | Visibility into planned upgrades or maintenance that might impact your services |

---

## When to Use

- **Detecting AWS-side issues** — If your application is degrading, check whether AWS is experiencing a service disruption first  
- **Correlating anomalies** — Use Health dashboard as one of the sources when investigating unexpected behavior  
- **Planning maintenance windows** — Be aware of AWS’s scheduled changes in advance  
- **Operational alerts** — Trigger notifications to your team when AWS publishes new events that might affect your services  

---

## How It Works (High-Level Flow)

1. AWS continuously monitors its own infrastructure and service components.  
2. When an issue or scheduled event is detected, AWS publishes a **Health event**.  
3. AWS Health Dashboard surfaces those events, filters them for your account & region, and provides relevant details.  
4. You (or automation) receive alerts via SNS / EventBridge and act accordingly (e.g. failover, resource migration, communication to stakeholders).

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Enable programmatic access**  
  Use AWS Health API or integrate with EventBridge so that your tooling/devops pipelines can respond automatically  
- **Combine with other monitoring services**  
  Use Health Dashboard *alongside* CloudWatch and CloudTrail to get a full picture (performance, actions, AWS-side issues)  
- **Use tags & resource filters**  
  Narrow down which events matter most (e.g. only for critical production resources)  
- **Set up escalation rules**  
  Not every event demands immediate action — classify which events trigger alerts vs which are informational  
- **Track historical events**  
  Use log archives and dashboards to analyze patterns (e.g. frequent maintenance windows in a region)

## Comparison with Related Services

| Service | Purpose | What It Doesn’t Do |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **CloudWatch** | Monitoring of resource metrics & logs | Doesn’t surface AWS-side infrastructure events |
| **CloudTrail** | API / user action auditing | Doesn’t monitor service health or performance |
| **AWS Health Dashboard** | Visibility into AWS infrastructure & events affecting your account | Doesn’t provide deep application-level metrics or logs |

## Summary  

The **AWS Health Dashboard** is your eyes into AWS’s own “backstage” — showing you when AWS services might be doing maintenance or facing outages that affect *your* resources. Use it together with CloudWatch (for your metrics) and CloudTrail (for user/API actions) to build a complete observability and incident response strategy.
