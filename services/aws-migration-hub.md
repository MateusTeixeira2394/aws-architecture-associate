**AWS Migration Hub** is a service that provides a single location to track the progress of application migrations across multiple AWS and partner solutions. It simplifies and streamlines the migration process by allowing you to monitor and manage migrations to AWS from a central dashboard, regardless of the tools or services you are using.

## Key Features of AWS Migration Hub:

1. **Centralized Tracking**: Provides a unified dashboard that allows you to monitor the migration status of applications across different AWS services and migration tools.
2. **Tool Flexibility**: Supports a wide range of AWS migration tools (e.g., AWS Application Migration Service, AWS Database Migration Service) as well as third-party partner tools, allowing you to choose the right tool for each migration task.
3. **Migration Status Visibility**: Offers detailed visibility into the migration status of individual servers and applications, so you can track the progress of your entire migration at a glance.

4. **Application Grouping**: Allows you to group related resources (servers, databases, etc.) into applications, enabling you to monitor the migration of an entire application as a single unit.

5. **Integration with AWS Services**: Works seamlessly with AWS migration services such as AWS Application Migration Service (MGN), AWS Server Migration Service (SMS), and AWS Database Migration Service (DMS), helping you manage and monitor all of your migrations from one place.

6. **Migration Readiness Assessment**: Provides tools to assess and improve your migration readiness, ensuring that your environment is prepared for migration to AWS.

7. **Cost Tracking**: Integration with AWS Cost Explorer allows you to track and analyze migration costs across AWS services and tools.

8. **Data Migration Insights**: Helps you gain insights into your data migration process, including data transfer rates, migration errors, and task status.

## Common Use Cases:

- **Application Migration**: Monitor and manage the migration of applications (composed of multiple resources such as servers, databases, and dependencies) from on-premises environments or other clouds to AWS.
- **Multi-Tool Migrations**: Use a variety of migration tools while still tracking progress centrally, such as using AWS Database Migration Service for databases and AWS Server Migration Service for server migrations.
- **Tracking Migration Status**: Get real-time updates on the migration status of individual resources or entire application groups across various regions and services.

- **Migration Planning**: Assess and optimize your cloud readiness, making it easier to plan, execute, and track your migration efforts across multiple environments.
