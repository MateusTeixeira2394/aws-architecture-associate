# 1. Introduction üìí

AWS Identity Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS services and resources for your users. It enables you to create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to allow or deny their access to AWS resources.

You can access it through:

- CLI (Command Line Interface);
- AWS Console;
- API;

# 2. Users, Groups and policies üßëüë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ üìú

- **Users**: Who can access to the services and work on them. When some user is created, by default it doesn't have any privileges.
- **Groups**: They organize the conjunct of users with the same privileges.
- **Roles**: They are applied to the AWS services instead of users.
- **Polices**: They are rules that can able or disable the access of groups or certain users.

# 3. Authentication üõ°Ô∏è

The user can authenticate itself through:

- Console: The user send its user **name**, **password** and **MFA** (Multi Factor Authentication) optionally.

- CLI and API: Both of them the user need to send its **access key id** and the **secret access key**.

**OBS**:

- You can manage the policy of password creations. For example, how strong the password must be with low case, up case, minimum and maximum length, especial characters, etc.

# 4. STS - Security Token Service üîê

![How the STS works](../imgs/sts.jpg)

WS Security Token Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users or for users you authenticate (federated users). These temporary credentials provide the same permissions as long-term security credentials, such as IAM user credentials

# 5. Entity Policy x Resource Policy üìù

In AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), identity policies and resource policies are two types of policies that define permissions for accessing AWS resources. They serve different purposes and are attached to different entities.

## 5.1. Entity Policy

They are applied to users, groups or roles.

### 5.1.1. Inline

When the policy is applied to one single user or role (1-1 relationship).

### 5.1.2. Customer managed / AWS managed

When the policy is applied to a groups (1-N relationship).

## 5.2. Resource Policy

When the policy is applied to a service (or resource) such as EC2, S3, etc.

# 6. Best practices üèÜ

- Do not use the root as user;
- Create IAM individual accounts;
- Create groups and policies to them instead of a single user;
- Allow as little permission as possible;
- As beginner, start using AWS managed instead of Customer managed policies;
- Able the MFA;
- Do always the revision of policy passwords;

# 7. Identity Federation üåêüîê

**Identity federation** in AWS is a method that allows users to access AWS resources using credentials from an external identity provider (IdP), without having to create separate IAM (Identity and Access Management) users in AWS for each user. This provides a secure and scalable way to manage authentication and access control across different systems.

## 7.1. Key features

- **Federated Identity Providers (IdP):**

  - AWS supports identity federation with well-known IdPs like Active Directory (AD), SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language), OpenID Connect (OIDC), and OAuth providers such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.

- **Temporary Security Credentials:**

  - Federated users are not assigned permanent IAM credentials. Instead, AWS issues temporary security credentials via AWS Security Token Service (STS). These credentials allow access to AWS resources for a limited period.

- **Single Sign-On (SSO):**

  - Federation allows SSO so that users can access AWS services with a single set of credentials from their enterprise or social IdP without needing separate AWS credentials.

- **SAML-based Federation:**

  - Often used with enterprise services like Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) or other SAML 2.0 providers to allow on-premises users to authenticate with AWS using their existing credentials.

- **Web Identity Federation:**
  - Used for apps that authenticate users via social IdPs (e.g., Google, Facebook, or Amazon Cognito). After authentication, AWS grants temporary access to resources such as S3 or DynamoDB.

## 7.2. Use cases

- **Enterprise SSO:** Allow employees to sign in to AWS using their corporate Active Directory credentials via a SAML IdP.
- **Web and Mobile Apps:** Allow users to sign in to AWS-powered applications using their social media accounts.
- **Cross-Account Access:** Federated access can also be used to allow users from one AWS account to access resources in another account without creating IAM users in each account.

## 7.3. How it works

1. The user logs into their external identity provider (such as AD, Google, etc.).
2. The IdP authenticates the user and provides an authentication token or assertion.
3. AWS uses STS to assume a role based on the user's identity and issues temporary security credentials.
4. The user gains temporary access to AWS resources, based on the permissions attached to the assumed IAM role.

## 7.4. Benefits

- **Centralized Authentication:** You manage user identities and permissions centrally, without needing to replicate users in AWS.
- **Increased Security:** Reduces the risk of managing multiple credentials across systems and allows for strong identity controls.
- **Simplified Access:** Users don‚Äôt need separate AWS credentials and can use their existing identities to gain access to AWS services.

**SAML Federation:** A company using Active Directory can allow employees to log in to AWS Management Console using their existing corporate credentials, thanks to SAML-based identity federation.
