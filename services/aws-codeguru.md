# AWS CodeGuru

## Overview  
AWS CodeGuru is a developer tool powered by machine learning that helps you improve code quality and application performance.  
It provides two main capabilities:  
- **CodeGuru Reviewer** — Automated code review suggestions for best practices, security, and efficiency.  
- **CodeGuru Profiler** — Runtime performance profiling to detect expensive lines of code and optimize resource usage.  

---

## Why use CodeGuru?

- **Improve code quality** — Automatically detect bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells before production  
- **Optimize performance** — Identify bottlenecks and hotspots in your applications  
- **Save costs** — Reduce unnecessary compute usage by improving inefficient code paths  
- **Enforce best practices** — Ensure your team follows consistent standards in code reviews  
- **Augment human reviewers** — Speed up pull requests and catch issues humans might miss

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **CodeGuru Reviewer** | Integrates with repositories (GitHub, Bitbucket, CodeCommit) to analyze pull requests and suggest improvements |
| **CodeGuru Profiler** | Monitors live applications, highlights the most resource-consuming methods, and recommends optimizations |
| **ML-powered recommendations** | Uses machine learning and Amazon’s own experience running massive scale systems |
| **Security insights** | Detects common security issues (e.g., hardcoded credentials, improper input handling) |
| **Integration with CI/CD** | Can be added to pipelines to provide automated reviews during the development lifecycle |

---

## When to Use

- **During code reviews** — Have CodeGuru Reviewer scan pull requests to augment manual reviews  
- **For long-running services** — Use Profiler to continuously analyze performance of production workloads  
- **In cost optimization efforts** — Identify unnecessary CPU cycles, memory usage, or inefficient loops that increase AWS bills  
- **In compliance/security checks** — Catch risky practices early (e.g., secrets in code)  

---

## How It Works (High-Level Flow)

1. **Reviewer**  
   - Connect your repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, or CodeCommit)  
   - CodeGuru analyzes commits and pull requests  
   - Developer receives recommendations in the PR with context and explanations  

2. **Profiler**  
   - Install and run the CodeGuru Profiler agent in your application  
   - It collects runtime data with minimal overhead  
   - CodeGuru Dashboard highlights the most expensive methods and provides recommendations for optimization

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Integrate early** — Add Reviewer to your CI/CD pipeline so that feedback comes before merging to main  
- **Use Profiler continuously** — Let it run in production to find real-world bottlenecks under actual load  
- **Prioritize high-impact recommendations** — Focus on fixes that improve both performance and cost efficiency  
- **Combine with CloudWatch** — Correlate profiling data with CloudWatch metrics for deeper troubleshooting  
- **Enable security scans** — Make use of security-focused rules to prevent vulnerabilities

## Comparison with Related Services

| Service | Purpose | What It Doesn’t Do |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **CodeGuru Reviewer** | Automated code review for quality & security | Doesn’t monitor runtime performance |
| **CodeGuru Profiler** | Detects performance bottlenecks at runtime | Doesn’t analyze static code |
| **SonarQube / ESLint** | Code linting & quality | Lacks AWS-native ML-driven insights and cost-focused recommendations |
