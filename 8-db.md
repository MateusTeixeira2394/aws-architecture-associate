# 1. Introduction 🚩

Amazon **Relational Database Service (RDS)** is a managed service provided by AWS that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It automates time-consuming tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups, allowing you to focus on your applications.

# 2. Supported SQL Databases 💿

RDS supports several popular database engines, including:
- Amazon Aurora (a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database)
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB
- Oracle Database
- Microsoft SQL Server

# 3. Multi-AZ x Read Replica 📈

## 3.1. Multi-AZ

**Multi-AZ** (Multiple Availability Zone) deployments provide high availability and failover support for DB instances. Here’s how it works:

- **Primary and Standby Instances**: When you create a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone (AZ). This replica is not directly accessible; it’s used for failover purposes.
- **Automatic Failover**: In the event of a failure (e.g., hardware failure, AZ outage), Amazon RDS automatically fails over to the standby replica to minimize downtime. The failover process is seamless and usually takes a few minutes.
- **Data Durability**: Multi-AZ deployments ensure that your data is replicated to the standby instance, providing durability and protection against data loss.

**Use Case**: Multi-AZ deployments are ideal for production databases where high availability and data durability are critical.

**Endpoint**: It uses a single DNS endpoint to connect to your RDS instance. This endpoint remains constant from the perspective of your application.

## 3.2. Read Replicas

**Read Replicas** are used to scale out read-heavy database workloads. They provide a way to offload read traffic from the primary database. Here’s how it works:

- **Asynchronous Replication**: Read Replicas use asynchronous replication to copy data from the primary database to one or more replica instances. This means there may be a slight delay between the primary database and the replicas.
- **Scaling Reads**: You can distribute read traffic across multiple Read Replicas to improve performance and reduce load on the primary instance.
- **Read-Only**: Read Replicas are read-only, meaning they cannot handle write operations. They are used solely for read queries.

**Use Case**: Read Replicas are useful for applications with heavy read workloads where scaling out read operations can help improve performance.

**Manual Setup**: Creating and managing Read Replicas involves manual setup. You specify which primary instance you want to replicate and how many replicas you want.

**Endpoint**: RDS instance has its own endpoint.

## 3.3. Summary

- **Multi-AZ**: Provides high availability and failover support by maintaining a synchronous standby replica in a different AZ. Best for critical production databases where uptime is crucial.
- **Read Replicas**: Improve read performance and scalability by asynchronously replicating data to one or more read-only instances. Best for applications with high read traffic.

You can use both features together to achieve high availability, data durability, and improved read performance.

# 4. Backups

- Automated: 1-35 days (1sec) -> s3 (free)
- Manual: DB snapshot

# 5. DynamoDB vs Elasticache

## 5.1. Dynamo
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed for applications that require low-latency, high-performance access to large amounts of data. DynamoDB is particularly well-suited for use cases such as real-time analytics, gaming, IoT, mobile apps, and more.

## 5.2. Elasticache

Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed in-memory data store and caching service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to improve the performance of your web applications by enabling faster data retrieval from in-memory databases, which can significantly reduce the load on your primary database.

## 5.3. Difference
