# 1. Introduction ðŸš©

A **Virtual Private Cloud** (VPC) in Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a virtual network that you can define within the AWS cloud. It allows you to control the networking environment of your AWS resources, providing isolation, security, and customization of your network settings. Here are some key features of a VPC:

- **Subnets**: You can divide your VPC into subnets, which are smaller networks within the VPC. Each subnet can be associated with a specific availability zone, providing high availability.

- **Routing**: VPCs allow you to define custom route tables to control the traffic flow between subnets and the internet.

- **Security Groups**: These act as virtual firewalls for your instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.

- **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)**: These provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level, controlling inbound and outbound traffic for subnets.

- **Internet Gateway**: To allow your instances within a VPC to connect to the internet, you can attach an Internet Gateway to your VPC.

- **NAT Gateway**: This allows instances in private subnets to connect to the internet while preventing inbound traffic from the internet.

- **Peering Connections**: VPC peering allows you to connect two VPCs, enabling communication between them as if they were part of the same network.

- **VPN and Direct Connect**: You can also connect your VPC to your on-premises data center using a VPN connection or AWS Direct Connect.

**OBS**: The VPC is a virtual (or logical) isolation your contents from another contents. It is not physics isolated. If you want, you can reserve a whole physical server or rack, for instance.

**OBS 2**: VPCs are associated by Region. So, it's possible different AZ (Available Zone) be in the same VPC, but not different Regions.

**OBS 3**: Even though some instances are in different subnets but they can communicate with each other because they are in the same VPC (EX: 10.0.0.0/16). However, you can configure to one subnet doesn't see other one.

**OBS 4**: When an instance is private, it can't access the internet, therefore, the user can't access the instance through aws console. The way to solve this is access the private instance through a public one in the same network. This process is called **Bastian Host**. In a nutshell, it acts as a gateway between your private network (where your private instances reside) and the outside world.

# 2. Transit Gateway vs Full Mesh

## 2.1. Transit Gateway
It is a highly scalable and central hub that you can use to connect your Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), on-premises networks, and even other AWS accounts. It simplifies your network architecture by acting as a central routing point for all your networks, enabling you to manage and scale your network more effectively.

## 2.2. Full Mesh
It refers to a network topology where each node (e.g., VPCs, on-premises networks) is directly connected to every other node. In a full mesh configuration, every possible connection between nodes is established, leading to high redundancy and reliability but also increased complexity as the number of connections grows.

## 2.3. Peering Connection

The Transit Gateway isn't a unique way to stablish a connection among VPCs. A **peering connection** refers to a network connection between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) that allows them to communicate with each other as if they were part of the same network. VPC Peering enables you to route traffic between the VPCs using private IP addresses, and it can be set up between VPCs in the same AWS account or across different AWS accounts.

If you have many VPCs or need to connect VPCs to on-premises networks, Transit Gateway simplifies the architecture by acting as a central hub.

For example, if you have 4 VPCs according to the image above, they need 6 peering connections. If the network increase, the number of connections will increase exponentially, turning this solution impracticable.
