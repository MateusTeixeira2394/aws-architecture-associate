# 1. Introduction ðŸ“’

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a scalable object storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.

## 1.1. Common Use Cases

- Backup and Restore: Storing backups of critical data and restoring it when needed.

- Data Archiving: Long-term storage of data that is infrequently accessed.

- Static Website Hosting: Hosting static websites and serving content directly from S3.

- Big Data Analytics: Storing large datasets for processing and analysis.

- Media Storage: Storing and serving media files such as images, videos, and documents.

# 2. Buckets ðŸª£

S3 organizes data into containers called buckets. Each bucket has a unique name and can contain any number of objects.

## 2.1. Core concepts

- Objects: The fundamental entity stored in S3. An object consists of the data (file), metadata (information about the file), and a unique key (identifier).

- Keys: The unique identifier for an object within a bucket. The combination of the bucket name and object key must be globally unique.

- Regions: S3 stores data in different AWS regions around the world. Choosing a region helps optimize latency and compliance.

# 2. Storage Classes ðŸ§©

| **Storage Class**          | **Use Case**                                          | **Durability**         | **Availability**       | **Storage Cost**       | **Characteristics**                                                                                             |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S3 Standard**            | Frequently accessed data                              | 99.999999999% (11 9's) | 99.99% over a year     | Highest                | Designed for frequently accessed data with low latency and high throughput.                                    |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** | Unknown or changing access patterns                   | 99.999999999% (11 9's) | 99.9% over a year      | Varies (based on access patterns) | Automatically moves data between frequent and infrequent access tiers based on usage.                            |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**         | Infrequently accessed data, rapid availability needed | 99.999999999% (11 9's) | 99.5% over a year      | Lower than S3 Standard | Lower cost; data stored in a single Availability Zone. Ideal for infrequent access data.                       |
| **S3 Glacier**             | Archival data rarely accessed                         | 99.999999999% (11 9's) | 99.9% over a year      | Lower cost             | Retrieval times range from minutes to hours.                                                                     |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive**| Long-term archival data rarely accessed               | 99.999999999% (11 9's) | 99.9% over a year      | Lowest                 | Lowest cost; retrieval times range from 12 to 48 hours.                                                            |
| **S3 Outposts**            | Local storage on AWS Outposts                         | 99.999999999% (11 9's) | 99.9% over a year      | Varies (based on Outpost) | Provides S3 storage on-premises for hybrid cloud environments.                                                     |

# 3. Versioning ðŸ”¢

Each S3 file can be versioned to:

- Protects against accidental or malicious deletion of objects;
- Protects against accidentally overwrite an object;
- Allows the user to track changes to objects over time. He can retrieve previous versions to review or revert to historical data.
- Maintaining different versions of an object provides an audit trail of changes and modifications;
- Adds an extra layer of redundancy;
- Restoring a previous version of an object is straightforward. You can easily retrieve and make use of older versions without complex recovery procedures;
- helps meet compliance and legal requirements by retaining historical data. This is particularly useful for organizations with data retention policies;

Obs ðŸ‘€: The file version is disabled by default. The use must enable it.

Aware ðŸ’¡: The user must be aware of using of version because it takes more space. for example, if a some.txt file has 3MB of size and there is a version 2 of some.txt file with 3.5MB, the some.txt file has 3MB + 3.5MB = 6Mb. And so on.
